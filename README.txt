Program 2
There are 5 java files. In CovertChannel.java, I implemented
the covert channel from the assignment description. It also
has a method that converts a ASCII character to a binary
string. In Instruction.java, I add the ability to take 
"create", "destroy", and "run" as commands. In 
ResourceMonitor.java, I added code to perform and check task
involving create, destroy, and run. SecureObject.java is the 
same SecureObject.java from the first project. In 
SecureSubject.java, the run method was added so that low level
subjects can read in the bit from high level subject. it also
contains the code to convery a binary string to an ascii 
character.
